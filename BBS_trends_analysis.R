# Will need to:
# 1. fit simpler models that ignore all relationship information, as 
#    well as phylogenetic slopes (linear) models for comparisons
# 2. leave 10% of combos (strata x species) out and generate
#    predictions; compute CRPS from each model; run several CV folds
# 3. assess variation in prediction accuracy across space and 
#    across the trees
# 4. visualise the proportional change in variance explained 
#    (as calculated above) on the tree to see if there are clusters
#    of species that depend more heavily on phylogenetic relationships
# 5. assess support for nonlinearity of trends; determine when trends
#    were accelerating / decelerating most rapidly
